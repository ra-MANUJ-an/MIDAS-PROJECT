# MIDAS-PROJECT

## About
Task 2 is being done (to train CNN) with part 1 at *[Project_task1.ipynb](https://github.com/ra-MANUJ-an/MIDAS-PROJECT/blob/main/Project_task1.ipynb)*, part 2 at *[Project_task2_v1.ipynb](https://github.com/ra-MANUJ-an/MIDAS-PROJECT/blob/main/Project_task2_v1.ipynb)* and *[Project_task2_v2.ipynb](https://github.com/ra-MANUJ-an/MIDAS-PROJECT/blob/main/Project_task2_v2.ipynb)*, part 3 at *[Project_task3.ipynb](https://github.com/ra-MANUJ-an/MIDAS-PROJECT/blob/main/Project_task3.ipynb)*.

Data was trained and tested on Two different models.

## Task 3 Observations
Comparing pre-trained and random model results it seems that data was incorrectly labelled.
